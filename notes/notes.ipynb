    "Recommended Feature Analysis Methods\n",
    "1. Exploratory Visualization (Seaborn/Matplotlib)\n",
    "Histograms & KDE plots → check distributions of compactness, surface area, wall/roof area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots → visualize how heating/cooling loads vary with compactness (X1) and height (X5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxplots → compare categorical features like orientation (X6) and glazing distribution (X8) against targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation heatmap → quickly spot linear relationships (e.g., compactness vs heating load is usually strong).\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This gives you intuition about which features matter most.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Statistical Feature Importance\n",
    "scikit-learn’s SelectKBest with f_regression → ranks features by correlation with heating/cooling loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Information → captures non-linear dependencies between features and targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Useful for identifying top predictors beyond simple correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model-Based Feature Importance\n",
    "RandomForestRegressor / GradientBoostingRegressor → tree-based models provide feature importance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost / LightGBM → more advanced boosting methods, often highlight compactness, surface area, and glazing as key drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutation Importance → robust, model-agnostic measure of how much each feature contributes to prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This is recommended if you plan to build predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explainability Tools\n",
    "SHAP (SHapley values) → shows both global feature importance and local explanations for individual predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIME → interprets model predictions feature-by-feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 These are especially valuable if you want to justify model decisions (e.g., why a building has high heating load).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Best Fit for Your Dataset\n",
    "Since your dataset is relatively structured and numeric:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with Seaborn/Matplotlib for profiling and correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use RandomForest/XGBoost feature importance to quantify which features drive heating/cooling loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply SHAP for deeper interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination balances statistical insight + predictive power + explainability."
